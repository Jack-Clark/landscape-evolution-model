#Landscape Evolution Modelling

This repository contains most of the work from my research internship at The School of Engineering and Computer Science, Durham University. However due to potential licensing issues the full code must remain in a private repository, and therefore this is only a fraction of the project's codebase.

The code in this repository contains fast GPU algorithms for computing the flow accumulation from a single flow direction grid and a grid of runoff weights, which is a fundamental part of landscape evolution modelling, and the performance limiter as the grid size grows.
Before starting my internship, the fastest algorithm was the [SFD_NoPart_List algorithm](https://github.com/Jack-Clark/landscape-evolution-model/blob/master/parallel-SFD-List.cu), 
which is an optimised version of the correct flow algorithm, described in [this paper](http://community.dur.ac.uk/stephen.mcgough/CV/Papers/2012/Land_paper.pdf). As described in the paper, the correctflow algorithm computes 99% of the grid's FA very quickly, taking ~400 iterations, however it takes a total of ~17000 iterations to fully complete, becoming essentially sequential for the last 1% of grid cells. During the internship, I managed to redesign the algorithm, so that using the previous example, a grid taking ~17000 iterations to complete would only take ~400 iterations to complete, which on the grid it was tested on, made it 2x faster than the original correctflow algorithm. The faster version is called the [Multiple Retries algorithm](https://github.com/Jack-Clark/landscape-evolution-model/blob/master/process_SFD_multiple_retries.cu). This result is particularly beneficial, because as the grid size grows, the flow accumulation computation time becomes responsible for >99% of the runtime, therefore doubling the speed of the FA algorithm leads to ~2x speedup of the whole simulation.
